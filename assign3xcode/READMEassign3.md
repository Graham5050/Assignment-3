 Program Description: This program is an example of using an ADT. In our case it is called NumberSet. Declaring a new NumberSet creates a structure with two members, items & count. We have a list of declared functions that are used to manipulate values of NumberSet. In this program there is a numberset and the program tries to insert numbers 1 to 11. The user enters an integer value and the number of integers less than the users value is printed to the screen. If userValue was an even number, the number of even elements is printed to the screen otherwise the number of odd elements is printed. The numbers 2, 6 and 13 are removed from the numberset with varying results. The revised values for less than and even/odd elements are printed to the screen and the program exits.
